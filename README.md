### Hello everyone, this repo includes three different algorithms which are created by using Python. 
### Exerecise1:
##### It relates Fibonacci numbers, then we can use the this formula:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?F_n(n)=F_{n-1}&plus;F_{n-1}" title="F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}" />,
### Exerecise2: 
##### We try to compute the Ackermann Function A(m,n) with m,n. Now, we can use the this formula:
* if m=0,then use n+1
* if m>0 and n=0, then use A(m-1,1)
* if m>0 and n>0, then use A(m-1,A(m,n-1))
### Exerecise3: 
##### We can consider the factorail of non-negative integer n. It means that the n can be 0. Then, we can explain some clear examples,
* 0!=1
* 1!=1
* 2!=1 * 2 = 2 
* 3!=1 * 2 * 3 = 6
* 4!=1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
##### P.S : I added the two version sof my code, so you can reach the code easily.
##### Thank You !!!
